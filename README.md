The ColorYeezy project is a bot that generate random colorways for Mr. West's sneakers. We post the results every hour on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coloryeezy). It's the exact opposite of what sneaker-related bots do. We don't take from the community. We're making more colorways for people to discuss and to enjoy seeing them.

It's like having 24 drops a day!
